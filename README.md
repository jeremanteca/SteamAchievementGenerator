## USAGE

1.  **Download the Latest Release:**
    *   Go to the [Releases page](https://github.com/jeremanteca/SteamAchievementGenerator/releases)
    *   Download the `.zip` file from the latest release (e.g., `SteamAchievementGenerator_1.0.0_.zip`).

2.  **Extract the Application:**
    *   Extract the contents of the downloaded `.zip` file to a folder in your computer (e.g., `C:\Programs`).

3.  **Download SteamDB Achievement Page of the game you want:**
    *   Open your web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).
    *   Navigate to the "Achievements" tab of a game on SteamDB. For example: `https://steamdb.info/app/1934570/stats/`
    *   Save the complete HTML page:
        *   In Chrome: Right-click on the page -> "Save as..." -> Choose "Webpage, Complete".
        *   In Firefox: Right-click on the page -> "Save Page As..." -> Choose "Web Page, complete".
    *   Save this HTML file (e.g., `South of Midnight Achievements · SteamDB.html`) along with the folder that comes with it (e.g., `South of Midnight Achievements · SteamDB_files`)          somewhere you can easily find it.

4.  **Run the program:**
    *   Open the folder where you extracted the application.
    *   Double-click `SteamAchievementGenerator.exe` to run it.

5.  **Select the HTML File:**
    *   Click the "Select HTML File..." button in the application.
    *   Navigate to and select the HTML file you downloaded in step 3.
    *   The application will display the game's information and the number of achievements found.

6.  **Generate Achievements:**
    *   Once the HTML is loaded and game info is displayed, click the "Generate Achievements" button.
    *   The application will:
        *   Create a new folder named `steam_settings` in the same directory as the HTML file you selected.
        *   Inside this output folder, it will generate:
            *   `achievements.json`: The JSON file with all achievement data.
            *   An `images` subfolder: Containing all downloaded achievement icons.
            *   `steam_appid.txt`: A text file with the game's App ID.
    *   A progress bar will show the status, and a success message will appear upon completion.

7.  **Placing the generated folder (steam_settings)**
    *   Navigate to your game folder (e.g., `C:\Games\South of Midnight`)
    *   Find where the `steam_api64.dll` is (e.g., `C:\Games\South of Midnight\Engine\Binaries\ThirdParty\Steamworks\Steamv152\Win64\`). Unreal Engine games like this have it there. Most game have it in the same folder where the game exe is.
    *   Put the generated folder (steam_settings) in there.
      
8.  **Creating a folder in Goldberg SteamEmu Saves**
    *   Press Win + R
    *   Type `%appdata%`
    *   Open folder called `Goldberg SteamEmu Saves`
    *   Create a new folder and name it as the App ID of your game (this App ID is in the `steam_appid.txt` generated by the program)

9.  **Check `Achievement Watcher`**
    *   Open `Achievement Watcher`
    *   The game should now appear


## Building from Source

If you wish to build the application from source:

1.  Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jeremanteca/SteamAchievementGenerator.git
    ```
2.  Open the solution file (`SteamAchievementGenerator.sln`) in Visual Studio 2022.
3.  Ensure you have the ".NET desktop development" workload installed.
4.  Restore NuGet packages (HtmlAgilityPack, Newtonsoft.Json).
5.  Select the "Release" configuration.
6.  Build the solution (Build -> Build Solution).
7.  The executable will be in `SteamAchievementGenerator/bin/Release/`.

## Troubleshooting

*   **"No achievement nodes found..." error:**
    *   Ensure you saved the *complete* HTML page from SteamDB, not just a partial source or an incorrect page.
    *   The structure of SteamDB's achievement page might have changed. If so, the parsing logic in the application may need an update.
*   **Images not downloading:**
    *   Check your internet connection.
    *   SteamDB might be temporarily blocking direct image downloads, or the image URLs might have changed. The application attempts to copy images from the local `_files` folder (created when saving a complete webpage) if direct download fails.
